# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [email validation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46155/how-can-i-validate-an-email-address-in-javascript) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
