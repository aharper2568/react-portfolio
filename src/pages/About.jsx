        Hello! My name is <b>Anthony Harper</b>. I'm a student in an EDx course for full-stack web development. So far I've learned a lot about HTML,CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end and back-end. So far I've had a lot of fun on my learning journey and hope to further my knowledge going forward. I have interests in developing mobile applications and working with health-related apps.
